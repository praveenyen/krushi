# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a simple todo application that allows users to manage their tasks locally in the browser. The application will use localStorage to persist todo items between browser sessions, providing a lightweight task management solution without requiring a backend server.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new todo items, so that I can keep track of tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters text in the input field and presses Enter THEN the system SHALL create a new todo item with the entered text
2. WHEN the user enters text in the input field and clicks the "Add" button THEN the system SHALL create a new todo item with the entered text
3. WHEN a new todo item is created THEN the system SHALL clear the input field
4. WHEN a new todo item is created THEN the system SHALL display it in the todo list
5. IF the input field is empty THEN the system SHALL NOT create a new todo item

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark todo items as completed, so that I can track my progress on tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a todo item's checkbox THEN the system SHALL toggle the completed status of that item
2. WHEN a todo item is marked as completed THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the completed state (e.g., strikethrough text)
3. WHEN a completed todo item is clicked again THEN the system SHALL mark it as incomplete

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete todo items, so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the delete button for a todo item THEN the system SHALL remove that item from the list
2. WHEN a todo item is deleted THEN the system SHALL immediately update the display to reflect the removal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my todo items to persist between browser sessions, so that I don't lose my tasks when I close and reopen the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds, completes, or deletes a todo item THEN the system SHALL save the updated todo list to localStorage
2. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display any previously saved todo items from localStorage
3. WHEN localStorage is empty or unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an empty todo list

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a count of my todo items, so that I can quickly understand how many tasks I have.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the todo list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the total number of todo items
2. WHEN the todo list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the number of completed items
3. WHEN the todo list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the number of remaining (incomplete) items
4. WHEN todo items are added, completed, or deleted THEN the system SHALL update the counts in real-time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have a split layout design, so that I can easily focus on different aspects of task management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a split layout with two equal halves
2. WHEN viewing the left half THEN the system SHALL show the app header and progress overview
3. WHEN viewing the right half THEN the system SHALL show the todo input form and todo list
4. WHEN using the application on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design principles

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to assign priorities to my todo items, so that I can organize tasks by importance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new todo item THEN the system SHALL allow me to select a priority level (low, medium, high)
2. WHEN no priority is explicitly selected THEN the system SHALL assign a default priority of "medium"
3. WHEN viewing todo items THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators for each priority level
4. WHEN viewing todo items THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors for different priority levels (red for high, yellow for medium, green for low)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sort my pending todo items, so that I can organize them according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing pending todos THEN the system SHALL provide sorting options (timestamp, priority, alphabetical)
2. WHEN sorting by timestamp THEN the system SHALL display newest items first
3. WHEN sorting by priority THEN the system SHALL display high priority items first, then medium, then low
4. WHEN sorting by alphabetical THEN the system SHALL display items in A-Z order
5. WHEN sorting is applied THEN the system SHALL only sort pending todos, keeping completed todos at the bottom
6. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL default to sorting by timestamp
