# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing todo application with Supabase integration to provide cloud-based authentication, data persistence, and settings synchronization. The integration will enable users to authenticate with Google, store their todos in the cloud, and sync their preferences (theme and timer settings) across devices while maintaining the existing functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with Google through Supabase, so that I can securely access my todos from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the application without being authenticated THEN the system SHALL display a Google sign-in button
2. WHEN the user clicks the Google sign-in button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth flow via Supabase Auth
3. WHEN the user successfully authenticates with Google THEN the system SHALL store the user session and redirect to the main todo interface
4. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their profile information (name, avatar) in the header
5. WHEN the user clicks sign out THEN the system SHALL clear the session and return to the sign-in screen
6. WHEN the user returns to the application with a valid session THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate them without requiring re-login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my todos to be stored in Supabase, so that I can access them from any device and never lose my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates a new todo THEN the system SHALL save it to the Supabase database with their user ID
2. WHEN an authenticated user loads the application THEN the system SHALL fetch and display their todos from Supabase
3. WHEN an authenticated user toggles a todo's completion status THEN the system SHALL update the record in Supabase
4. WHEN an authenticated user deletes a todo THEN the system SHALL remove it from the Supabase database
5. WHEN an authenticated user modifies todo priority THEN the system SHALL update the priority in Supabase
6. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and maintain local state
7. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL queue changes and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my theme preference to be synced across devices, so that my interface looks consistent everywhere I use the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user changes their theme preference THEN the system SHALL save it to their Supabase user profile
2. WHEN an authenticated user loads the application THEN the system SHALL apply their saved theme preference
3. WHEN the user switches between light and dark themes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the interface and save the preference
4. WHEN a new user first authenticates THEN the system SHALL use the system default theme and save it as their preference
5. IF theme sync fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to local storage for theme persistence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my timer settings to be synced across devices, so that my productivity workflow is consistent everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user modifies timer settings (work duration, break duration, etc.) THEN the system SHALL save them to their Supabase user profile
2. WHEN an authenticated user loads the application THEN the system SHALL apply their saved timer settings
3. WHEN timer settings are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately sync the changes to Supabase
4. WHEN a new user first authenticates THEN the system SHALL use default timer settings and save them as their preference
5. IF timer settings sync fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to local storage for settings persistence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless migration from local storage to cloud storage, so that I don't lose my existing todos when I first sign in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with existing local todos first authenticates THEN the system SHALL migrate their local todos to Supabase
2. WHEN migration is successful THEN the system SHALL clear the local storage todos to prevent duplication
3. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL keep local todos and allow manual retry
4. WHEN a user signs in on a device with local todos that conflict with cloud todos THEN the system SHALL merge them intelligently
5. WHEN migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with migration status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time synchronization of my todos, so that changes made on one device appear immediately on other devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a todo is created, updated, or deleted on one device THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the change on all other active sessions
2. WHEN multiple users share the same account THEN the system SHALL sync changes across all sessions in real-time
3. WHEN real-time sync is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to periodic polling for updates
4. WHEN conflicts occur between simultaneous edits THEN the system SHALL use last-write-wins conflict resolution
5. WHEN real-time connection is lost THEN the system SHALL display connection status and attempt to reconnect

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work offline with local caching, so that I can continue using it even without internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL continue to function with locally cached data
2. WHEN the user makes changes while offline THEN the system SHALL queue them for sync when connection is restored
3. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync all queued changes to Supabase
4. WHEN sync conflicts occur after reconnection THEN the system SHALL resolve them using server data as the source of truth
5. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL display offline status indicator

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and loading states, so that users have a smooth experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with retry options
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages and fallback options
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging while maintaining user privacy
